          <h2>Visa Information </h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            &nbsp &nbsp A visa is a travel document issued by authorized government agencies to foreign citizens applying to enter, exit from or transit through the host country's territory based on the host country's laws and regulations. In accordance with international law and practice, any sovereign state is entitled to decide on whether or not to allow a foreign citizen to enter or exit from its territory, and whether to issue a visa, decline a visa application or to cancel an issued visa in accordance with its national laws. Spanish consular officials are entitled to decide on the type, number of entries, validity and duration of each stay of a visa to be issued based on Spanish and European laws and regulations. Consular officials reserve the right to decline a visa application or revoke an issued visa.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp &nbsp Foreign citizens must obtain a Spanish visa before entry into Spain, with the exception of visa-free entry based on relevant agreements or regulations. <a href="http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Consulados/LONDRES/en/Consulado/Pages/CheckPassport.aspx">Check beforehand if you require a visa to enter Spain</a>. If you have issued a previous visa, check its validity before traveling to Spain; if the visa has expired or the number of entries is not enough, you must apply for a new visa.
          </p>
